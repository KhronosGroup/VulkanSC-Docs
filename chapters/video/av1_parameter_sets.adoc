AV1 Sequence Header::

Represented by code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader structures and interpreted as
follows:

  * code:flags.reserved and code:reserved1 are used only for padding
    purposes and are otherwise ignored;
  * the code:StdVideoAV1ColorConfig structure pointed to by
    code:pColorConfig is interpreted as follows:
  ** code:flags.reserved and code:reserved1 are used only for padding
     purposes and are otherwise ignored;
  ** all other members of code:StdVideoAV1ColorConfig are interpreted as
     defined in section 6.4.2 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>;
  * if code:flags.timing_info_present_flag is set, then the
    code:StdVideoAV1TimingInfo structure pointed to by code:pTimingInfo is
    interpreted as follows:
  ** code:flags.reserved is used only for padding purposes and is otherwise
     ignored;
  ** all other members of code:StdVideoAV1TimingInfo are interpreted as
     defined in section 6.4.3 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>;
  * all other members of code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader are interpreted as
    defined in section 6.4 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.
