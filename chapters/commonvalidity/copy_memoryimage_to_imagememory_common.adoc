// This relies on an additional attribute {imageparam} set by the command
// which includes this file, specifying the name of the source or

// Additionally, it relies on the {imagesubresource} attribute to specify the

// Finally, it relies on the {imageoffset} and {imageextents} attributes to
// specify the fields in pRegions corresponding to the offset and extent of the
// copy.
