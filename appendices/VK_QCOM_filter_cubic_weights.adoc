=== Description

This extension extends cubic filtering by adding the ability to select a set
of weights.
Without this extension, the weights used in cubic filtering are limited to
those corresponding to a Catmull-Rom spline.
This extension adds support for 3 additional spline weights.

This extension adds a new structure that can: be added to the pname:pNext
chain of slink:VkSamplerCreateInfo that can: be used to specify which set of
cubic weights are used in cubic filtering.
A similar structure can be added to the pname:pNext chain of
slink:VkBlitImageInfo2 to specify cubic weights used in a blit operation.

With this extension weights corresponding to the following additional
splines can be selected for cubic filtered sampling and blits:

  * Zero Tangent Cardinal
  * B-Spline
  * Mitchell-Netravali
