=== Description

`VK_IMG_format_pvrtc` provides additional texture compression functionality
specific to Imagination Technologies PowerVR Texture compression format
(called PVRTC).

[NOTE]
====
As also noted in the <<data-format, Khronos Data Format Specification>>,
PVRTC1 images must have dimensions that are a power of two.
====

=== Deprecation

Both PVRTC1 and PVRTC2 are slower than standard image formats on PowerVR
GPUs, and support will be removed from future hardware.
