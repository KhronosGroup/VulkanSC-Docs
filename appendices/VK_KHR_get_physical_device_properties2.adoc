=== Description

This extension provides new queries for device features, device properties,
and format properties that can be easily extended by other extensions,
without introducing any further queries.
The Vulkan 1.0 feature/limit/formatproperty structures do not include
ptext:sType/ptext:pNext members.
This extension wraps them in new structures with ptext:sType/ptext:pNext
members, so an application can query a chain of feature/limit/formatproperty
structures by constructing the chain and letting the implementation fill
them in.
A new command is added for each ftext:vkGetPhysicalDevice* command in core
Vulkan 1.0.
The new feature structure (and a pname:pNext chain of extending structures)
can also be passed in to device creation to enable features.

This extension also allows applications to use the physical-device
components of device extensions before flink:vkCreateDevice is called.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.1

All functionality in this extension is included in core Vulkan 1.1, with the
KHR suffix omitted.
The original type, enum and command names are still available as aliases of
the core functionality.

=== Examples

[source,c++]
----
    // Get features with a hypothetical future extension.
    VkHypotheticalExtensionFeaturesKHR hypotheticalFeatures =
    {
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_HYPOTHETICAL_FEATURES_KHR,
        .pNext = NULL,
    };

    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR features =
    {
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FEATURES_2_KHR,
        .pNext = &hypotheticalFeatures,
    };

    // After this call, features and hypotheticalFeatures have been filled out.
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR(physicalDevice, &features);

    // Properties/limits can be chained and queried similarly.

    // Enable some features:
    VkHypotheticalExtensionFeaturesKHR enabledHypotheticalFeatures =
    {
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_HYPOTHETICAL_FEATURES_KHR,
        .pNext = NULL,
    };

    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR enabledFeatures =
    {
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FEATURES_2_KHR,
        .pNext = &enabledHypotheticalFeatures,
    };

    enabledFeatures.features.xyz = VK_TRUE;
    enabledHypotheticalFeatures.abc = VK_TRUE;

    VkDeviceCreateInfo deviceCreateInfo =
    {
        .sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_CREATE_INFO,
        .pNext = &enabledFeatures,
        ...
        .pEnabledFeatures = NULL,
    };

    VkDevice device;
    vkCreateDevice(physicalDevice, &deviceCreateInfo, NULL, &device);
