=== Description

This extension automatically paces the CPU to make sure it does not get too
far ahead of the GPU, reducing the latency between inputs received and
updates on the screen.
Additionally, Anti-Lag+ offers applications the ability to inform the driver
when input processing begins, in order to align the timing of display
updates, enabling even lower latency between receiving input and displaying
on the screen.
